\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
The greatest of thanks goes to my supervisor, professor L. Fatibene, for his evergreen willingness, for enabling me to get in the beautiful field of modern physics, as a mathematician. I am also grateful to professor V. Moretti, for his assistance and support, together with all the Mathematical Physics' professors who have helped me find my way in this vast field of research. 

Heartfelt thanks are due to my parents and relatives, especially my sister and my mother and father, for their unwavering support throughout my journey. I am deeply grateful to my friends, both old and new, from the lightest to the most intense of them, for their companionship and encouragement along this thoughtful path. %Each one has left an indelible mark, and I am forever grateful for their presence.
I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my colleagues and companions, my math's mates, with whom I have shared both challenges and triumphs, for all those times when the exchange of ideas became so profound as to seem to unveil some secret key of the world.

\begin{abstract}
    %Una topic sentence del core del lavoro. Poi i body paragraphs: Prima dovremo risolvere il problema di adattare QFT a una teoria gravitazionale, questo sarà fatto prendendo come lume la generale covarianza che si generalizzerà alla background--independence, e verrà fuori Holst che dipende dai frames e dalla connessione di spin, che tiene in se le simmetrie di gauge e c è un campo sullo spaziotempo. Poi dobbiamo studiare la teoria classica vincolata e caratterizzare i suoi che in vista dell'hole argument risulteranno essere classi di gauge di connessioni di spin.  Infine un processo di quantizzazione verrà adattato a questa teoria, proponendo una quantum field theory generalmente covariante. A posteriori, si noteranno evidenze matematiche che gli operatori quantistici descriventi le osservabili del campo gravitazionale corrispondono a quantità geometriche di tetraedri.
    Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) stands at the forefront of modern theoretical and mathematical physics as a promising framework seeking to reconcile General Relativity (GR) with Quantum Mechanics (QM). This thesis delves into the foundational principles and mathematical underpinnings of LQG. 
    
    The present work is articulated into three distinct chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of the formulation and analysis of the theory. The first chapter introduces the fundamental mathematical concepts that underpin the theory, providing a solid foundation for understanding the subsequent theoretical developments. The second chapter examines the formulation of GR in a manner suitable for quantisation as a generally covariant Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Finally, the third chapter outlines in detail covariant LQG up to the theory of spin networks and knots, which eventually can be interpreted as describing a quantum theory of the classical geometry of tetrahedra.
    
    In conclusion, this thesis aims to offer a comprehensive and in--depth overview of LQG, with a focus on the geometric observables of spacetime, having the mathematical aspects as a focal point of inquiry. Through a detailed analysis of the mathematical concepts and physical implications of LQG, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the quest for a coherent quantum theory of gravity and new avenues for further theoretical developments in the field of mathematical physics are left open.
    
    %exploring its evolution from a novquantum theory of gravity. The aim of this thesis is to explore the mathematical formalism of LQG and analyze how it articulates in the attempt to provide a coherent quantum description of spacetime and gravity,.

%The journey begins with an examination of LQG's fundamental premise: the harmonious coexistence of GR and QM. Through meticulous analysis and mathematical formalism, this thesis elucidates the intricate interplay between these two pillars of modern physics, showcasing how LQG adeptly incorporates the geometric insights of GR into a coherent quantum framework.

%Building upon this foundation, the thesis navigates through key milestones in the development of LQG, including the formulation of the Barbero-Immirzi connection and the canonical analysis yielding boundary equations. Attention is also given to the abstraction of spacetime geometry through the lens of spinfoams, shedding light on the dynamic aspects of LQG's mathematical framework.

%Furthermore, this thesis explores novel approaches within LQG, such as the integration of infinite-dimensional representations of $\SL(2,\C)$ and the exploration of $3$--dimensional formulations, offering fresh perspectives and avenues for future research.

%Through a comprehensive synthesis of theoretical principles and mathematical formalism, this thesis not only provides a thorough understanding of Loop Quantum Gravity but also contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding the unification of GR and QM. As LQG continues to evolve and refine, this research lays the groundwork for further exploration and advancement in the quest for a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity.


%This thesis focuses on exploring Loop Quantum Gravity with a specific emphasis on describing the geometric observables of spacetime. The scope of the work will extend from laying out the foundational mathematical concepts to detailing the formulation of GR suitable for quantization as a generally covariant quantum field theory. The thesis will culminate in an exposition of LQG up to the theory of spin networks and knots, as well as the quantum geometries of tetrahedra in spacetime.
